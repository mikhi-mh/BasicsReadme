# programming

use `for` loop

now languages

```c
//this is code for c programming language
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, World !");
    return 0;
}
/*
this is c code in markdown file
just simple code
*/
```
this was c 

now we will look into cpp



```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout<<"Hello, World !";
    return 0;

}
```

this was the cpp now we will see its Java version

```java
class Main
{
    public static void Main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello World !");
    }
}
````

or
```java
class Main{

    public static void Main(String[] args){

        System.out.println("Hello World !");
    }
}
```
